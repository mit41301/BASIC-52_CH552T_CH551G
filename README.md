Atmel C51ASM V1.2 assembler used for assembling the Source Assembly File. CH552T uses internal 24 MHz oscillator. Also uses on-chip internal 1kB xRAM. All the pins of PORT1 is available and mapped to DIP-40 package pinout. The HEX file also contains the I2C extension which is useful for interacting with I2C devices. SFR read and write also implemented which is useful for exploring the internal registers and ports.
